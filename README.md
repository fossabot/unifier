# (not) Unifier
[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fgreeeen-dev%2Funifier.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fgreeeen-dev%2Funifier?ref=badge_shield)

Unifier no longer exists on this repository.

----

After we decided to open source our stuff, we moved our repositories to [UnifierHQ](https://github.com/UnifierHQ).
I've just decided to make this blank repository so that's clear.

- **If you're looking for the upstream repository**

  https://github.com/UnifierHQ/unifier

- **If you're looking for my personal fork (there's no active development on there)**
